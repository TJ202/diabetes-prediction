# Prediction of Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes in Mothers above 21 years of age with Machine Learning Models

## About the Project

The purpose of this project titled, ‘Prediction of Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes in Mothers above 21 years of age with Machine Learning Models’, is to build a website which collects relevant user details and predicts their diabetic condition using a Machine Learning model. 

The target users for our project are mothers over the age of 21 who are relatively more prone to diabetes. They can use the website for self-diagnosis, helping them make better health decisions and get medical consultation to avoid future complications. We applied various Machine Learning algorithms and performed several data cleansing techniques to increase the accuracy and precision of prediction of Pre-diabetes and Diabetes using relevant health attributes through this project.

## Deployment

To run the application, go to the cloned repository and type `python app.py` in the VSCode Command Prompt. <br>
This will open the application on localhost which can be accessed from the command prompt itself.

To host the website on Heroku, type the following in your terminal after creating a GitHub repository
```
git login
git add .
git commit -m "changes made"
git push origin main
git push heroku main
```
